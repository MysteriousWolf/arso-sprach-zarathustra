# An unofficial ARSO Discord bot
Generates a config file when launched for the first time. Set your Discord bot token and launch it!

## Requirements
Along with the Python requirements in the `requirements.txt` file, the html2image library also needs a browser to generate screenshots. Due to compatibility reasons `chromium-headless-shell` is used and needs to be installed and in `PATH`.

**NOTE: This bot is in no way affiliated with [ARSO](https://www.arso.gov.si/), but uses their official API to collect weather information.**
